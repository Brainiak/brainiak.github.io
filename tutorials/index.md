Advanced fMRI analyses have the potential to answer questions that are otherwise impossible to answer with more mainstream methods. BrainIAK aims to integrate various cutting-edge techniques (e.g., Multi-voxel pattern analysis, full correlation matrix analysis, inter-subject correlation, shared response modeling, etc.) into one an environment and package. However, to get started using these tools can seem overwhelming and insurmountable.
<br><br>
To help users of all skill levels get up to speed with the methods used in BrainIAK, we have created a set of tutorials to introduce various cutting-edge fMRI analysis techniques. These tutorials are generally organized based on their method of interest but also all contain an overarching scientific question that may be answered using the method taught in the tutorial. They are built using Jupyter notebooks and use functions in nibabel, nilearn, scikit-learn, and BrainIAK. Each tutorial can be run independently, allowing users with some background to skip ahead and do only the tutorials that they are interested. At the same time, the sequence of tutorials is such that learning from one tutorial is scaffolded on the content of previous tutorials. As such, these tutorials can be used as problem sets for a course on advanced methods. In fact, this has been done at both Princeton and Yale University.

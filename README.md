## Getting started (MacOS)
Instructions for other operating systems should be straightforward. Dependencies on ```node``` and ```bundler```.
```bash
# Install dependencies
./bin/install.sh

# Add the following line to .bash_profile or other
# [[ -s "$HOME/.rvm/scripts/rvm" ]] && . "$HOME/.rvm/scripts/rvm"

# Start live-reload server
gulp
```

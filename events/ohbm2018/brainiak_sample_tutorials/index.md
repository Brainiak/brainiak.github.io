# BrainIAK Sample Tutorials
<div class='row text'>
<div class='col-lg-6'>

We have tutorials that cover materials 
from the basics of Machine Learning to advanced fMRI analysis. They are all built using Jupyter notebooks. The entire tutorial set is undergoing alpha testing currently. 
We plan to release the full set of tutorials in <b>early 2019.</b> 
Below, we have a sample of the tutorials that we have created. Please click the links below to view these tutorials. Each tutorial has an associated dataset against which it is run.
The tutorials may be easily modified to point to your own data.  </div></div>
